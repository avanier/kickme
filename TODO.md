# To Do

- Make master script
- Do platform detection and make it globally available as a variable
- Develop each prank as a module
- Make a compile script to _"minify"_ all the scripts together
- CI/CD all the things
- The script should store a counter on the victim's computer to automatically
  increase nastiness applied to repeat offenders

# Evil ideas

- Track cursor position on X and flip the destination screen every time you
  touch a boundary in a multiscreen setup.
- Provide an evil physical delivery platform like [this](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1)
